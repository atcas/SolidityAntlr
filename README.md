# SolidityAntlr

Implementation of Solidity's grammar with antlr 4.5 and based of [ECMAScript.g4](https://github.com/antlr/grammars-v4/tree/master/ecmascript).

The grammar doesn't validate building please, you use solc to build and to validate. The grammar was designed to analyse code 

The grammar used the test of case [Solidity Features](https://pages.github.com/).

#TODO
- [ ] Integration with [AssemblySolidityAntlr](https://github.com/atcas/AssemblySolidityAntlr).
